# Smart Doorbell System
Course project CSD513 Internet of Things at IIT(ISM) Dhanbad.

## Abstract
For the course project we made a smart doorbell system. We coudln't implement some parts of the project because of lack of hardware availability at the time of making the project.

## Description
A person presses the capture button on the screen taking his/her picture. This picture is then verified with a set of pictures already registered before hand in the system. If there is a match then we have a known person. The door lock will open for sometime and lock itself. If there is no match then the picture of the unknown person along with a randomly generated 6 digit OTP pin is sent via mail to the owner of the house.
